 ## 1.1 Fields
 This book assumes that you the reader is familiar with elementary algebra of real and complex numbers.

#### Properties of Algebra

Let $F$ denote either the set of real numbers or the set of complex numbers.

**1. Addition is commutative**,
		$$
		x + y = y + x
		$$
		for all $x$ and $y$ in $F$.
 **2. Addition is associative**,
 $$
 x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z
 $$
		 for all $x$ and $y$ in $F$.
**3. Multiplication is commutative,**
$$
xy = yx
$$
		for all $x$ and $y$ in $F$.
**4. Multiplication is associative**
