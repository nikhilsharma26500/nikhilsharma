## 1.1 Fields

This book assumes that the reader is familiar with elementary algebra of real and complex numbers.

### Properties of Algebra

Let $F$ denote either the set of real numbers or the set of complex numbers.

**1. Closure under Addition:**
For any two elements $a, b \in F$:
$$
a + b \in F
$$

**2. Closure under Multiplication:**
For any two elements $a, b \in F$:
$$
ab \in F
$$

**3. Commutativity of Addition:**
For any two elements $a, b \in F$:
$$
a + b = b + a
$$

**4. Associativity of Addition:**
For any three elements $a, b, c \in F$:
$$
(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
$$

**5. Additive Identity:**
There exists an element $0 \in F$ such that for any $a \in F$:
$$
a + 0 = a
$$

**6. Additive Inverse:**
For each element $a \in F$, there exists an element $-a \in F$ such that:
$$
a + (-a) = 0
$$

**7. Commutativity of Multiplication:**
For any two elements $a, b \in F$:
$$
ab = ba
$$

**8. Associativity of Multiplication:**
For any three elements $a, b, c \in F$:
$$
(ab)c = a(bc)
$$

**9. Multiplicative Identity:**
There exists an element $1 \in F$ such that for any $a \in F$:
$$
a \cdot 1 = a
$$

**10. Multiplicative Inverse:**
For each non-zero element $a \in F$, there exists an element $a^{-1} \in F$ such that:
$$
a \cdot a^{-1} = 1
$$

#### Field
Suppose there is a set $F$ of elements $x$, $y$, $z$,... with two operations, addition and multiplication, that satisfy the properties of *algebra*. Then $F$ is called a **field**.

With the usual operations of addition and multiplication, the set $C$ of complex numbers is a field. The set $R$ of real numbers is also a field.
